Polymorphic Use
 - Shifing polymorphism from type to use allows for  greater reuse and fewer endencies
 - Using regular semantics for the common basis operations, copy, assignment, and move helps to reduce shared objects
 - Regular types promote interoperability of sofware components, increases productivity as well as quality, security, and performance
 - No performance penalty to using regular semantics, and often times performance benefits from a decreased use of the heap
